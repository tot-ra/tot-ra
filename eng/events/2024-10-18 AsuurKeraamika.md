Are you planning a team building event and bored of bowling and billiard?  
  
Try pottery. Clay is like playdough and looks simple, but it's like programming and can reveal personal taste. You have a product vision, tight deadlines and extra features you want to include.  
  
You can go straight in and fail fast to quickly recover (like I did) . Or you can plan ahead, cut different parts and assemble it like a puzzle, waterfall-style. Naturally you must be aware of tools and integration tricks.  
  
Finally you ship it for glazing and hope that users will find it useful and beautiful
