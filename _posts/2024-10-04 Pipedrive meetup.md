Listening to [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABOtRMkBl5GVjNulXmUgn5Xp35BRy3kyqx8)[Elizaveta Lebedeva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizaveta-lebedeva/) talk on fraud detection reminded me of similar talk at [Wise](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wiseaccount/) couple of years ago.  
  
Maybe such anomalies and trends could be shared? An idea for a fraud/security startup ðŸ˜‰
