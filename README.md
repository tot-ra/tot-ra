## Hi, I'm Artjom 

I'm a full-stack software engineer. My focus is on a full-stack product development.
I'm interested in ML, video processing and robotics 🤖. 

- I'm practicing second-brain type of note taking with obsidian and other 💻[workstation scripts](https://github.com/tot-ra/workstation)
- Public thoughts are published in [my blog](https://kurapov.ee/)
- Some of those thoughts are published on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/artkurapov)

Check out my [vector db](https://github.com/tot-ra/vector-bible) benchmarks

Also I'm a founder of [Gratheon](https://gratheon.com) 🐝.
It needs your help with electrical engineering, robotics, UX, design.
