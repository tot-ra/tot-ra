## Hi, I'm Artjom 

I'm a full-stack software engineer. My focus is on a full-stack product development.
I'm interested in ML, video processing and robotics 🤖.

- Public thoughts are published in [my blog](https://kurapov.ee/)
- Some of those thoughts are published on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/artkurapov)
